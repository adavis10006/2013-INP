## 2013 NCTU INP

### Outline

This repository contains 3 projects:

* Concurrent Chat Room
* Nonblocking Broadcast
* UDP Connection

### Concurrent Chat Room

In this homework, you will build up a chat room system. It contains two programs, a server and a client. Clients that connect to the same server can “talk” to one another. Server accepts connections from multiple clients, which stand for multiple users. Once a user types some messages and presses “Enter” to send messages to server, all other valid (will be defined latter in specification) users will see these messages on their screen.

### Nonblocking Broadcast

### UDP Connection
